# RugbyPitchEventTagger

This is a small program which enables events during a rugby match to be plotted on a pitch. The current version is something I use to plot place kick locations and to automatically calculate the predicted kick success (%) of the place kick via a previously developed binomial logistic regression model (created using data from all place kicks at the 2019 Rugby World Cup).
